# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If found any vulnerability/bug you can share it with me at [Issue Tab](https://github.com/000Zer000/ZKit/issues/new/choose)
 ### tips for enough infomation but not too much 
 When it comes to security its nothing more important . sharing information to the developing team or developer (in this case)
 Is great. BUT SECURITY FIRST . 
  1. taking screenshots from issue is great . but dont show any sensetive information in your screen shot . it could be dangerous.
  2. Emails are good tools for making fast convercation but its dangerous too .dont give us your email . Recommended to search for your answer on your opened issue .
  3. Phone numbers are great ids . but dangerous too . Dont share any phone number. its too sensetive . and we cant contact you from your phone number
