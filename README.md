ZKit Is A Framework Written In Pure Python For Hacking . HACKING IS COLORFUL .

It can generate rootkit (reverse shell and file transfer) , run dos attacks , controllers for having the fun and can fool AVs with random variable names , encryption of malware and decrypting in runtime .

Special Thanks to this project's first watcher and stargazer [Flechablanca19](https://github.com/flechablanca19)

Need an update , found an issue or want a feature ? Fell free to open an issue and tell me your idea .

have an idea ? or have a request ?  [Now you can contact me](https://github.com/000Zer000/ZKit-Framework/blob/master/README.md#contact-author)

[Documentation](https://github.com/000Zer000/ZKit-Framework/wiki) is complete and updated .

## ZKit Can

    - Run dos attacks

    - Build rootkit TCP and UDP

    - Buid file transfer payload (reverse shell rootkit features included too) both TCP and UDP

    - Payload uses an encryption method and random variable names to fool the AVs . Virus total result is : 0/59
  
NOTE : windows payloads have to be compiled to work . but not for linux payloads . because linux has python built-in .

If so [donate](https://github.com/000Zer000/ZKit-Framework/edit/master/README.md#donating ) to show your love to hacking and Be in **OUR HEROES__ list in readme with your favorite sentence .see your self on top or you can star this project to show your support.you can watch this repo for getting notification for amazing changes .

## ZKit will be able to

    - Compile to diffrent operating systems

    - Create ransomware (Next release)

    - Run more powerful and more customizable dos attacks

    - Create and manage Botnets

    - Create user payload (write your own payload with zkit features)

    - Port Scanning

    - Causing remote bufferoverflow

    - IP and network tools (reverse ip, reverse DNS, etc)

    - Building a GUI (for guys that dont like command-line tools)

    - Even working on ios attacks

    - Adding Configuration
